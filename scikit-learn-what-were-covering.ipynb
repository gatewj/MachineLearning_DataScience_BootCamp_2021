    "## Why Scikit-Learn?\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the field of machine learning is vast, the main goal is finding patterns within data and then using those patterns to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "And there are certain categories which a majority of problems fall into.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're trying to create a machine learning model to predict whether an email is spam and or not spam, you're working on a classification problem (whether something is something(s) or another).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're trying to create a machine learning model to predict the price of houses given their characteristics, you're working on a regression problem (predicting a number).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you know what kind of problem you're working on, there are also similar steps you'll take for each. Steps like splitting the data into different sets, one for your machine learning algorithms to learn on and another to test them on. Choosing a machine learning model and then evaluating whether or not your model has learned anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-Learn offers Python implementations for doing all of these kinds of tasks. Saving you having to build them from scratch."

    "The recommended steps you take are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Try it** - Since Scikit-Learn has been designed with usability in mind, your first step should be to use what you know and try figure out the answer to your own question (getting it wrong is part of the process). If in doubt, run your code.\n",
    "2. **Press SHIFT+TAB** - See you can the docstring of a function (information on what the function does) by pressing **SHIFT + TAB** inside it. Doing this is a good habit to develop. It'll improve your research skills and give you a better understanding of the library.\n",
    "3. **Search for it** - If trying it on your own doesn't work, since someone else has probably tried to do something similar, try searching for your problem. You'll likely end up in 1 of 2 places:\n",
    "    * [Scikit-Learn documentation/user guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html) - the most extensive resource you'll find for Scikit-Learn information.\n",
    "    * [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - this is the developers Q&A hub, it's full of questions and answers of different problems across a wide range of software development topics and chances are, there's one related to your problem.\n",
    "    \n",
    "An example of searching for a Scikit-Learn solution might be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **\"how to tune the hyperparameters of a sklearn model\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "Searching this on Google leads to the Scikit-Learn documentation for the GridSearchCV function: [http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/grid_search.html](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/grid_search.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "The next steps here are to read through the documentation, check the examples and see if they line up to the problem you're trying to solve. If they do, **rewrite the code** to suit your needs, run it, and see what the outcomes are.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ask for help** - If you've been through the above 3 steps and you're still stuck, you might want to ask your question on [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com/). Be as specific as possible and provide details on what you've tried.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, you don't have to learn all of the functions off by heart to begin with.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's most important is continually asking yourself, \"what am I trying to do with the data?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by answering that question and then practicing finding the code which does it.\n",
    "\n",

    "Once your data is all in numerical format, there's one more transformation you'll probably want to do to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's called **Feature Scaling**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, making sure all of your numerical data is on the same scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say you were trying to predict the sale price of cars and the number of kilometres on their odometers varies from 6,000 to 345,000 but the median previous repair cost varies from 100 to 1,700. A machine learning algorithm may have trouble finding patterns in these wide-ranging variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this, there are two main types of feature scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Normalization** (also called min-max scaling) - This rescales all the numerical values to between 0 and 1, with the lowest value being close to 0 and the highest previous value being close to 1. Scikit-Learn provides functionality for this in the MinMaxScalar class.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Standardization** - This subtracts the mean value from all of the features (so the resulting features have 0 mean). It then scales the features to unit variance (by dividing the feature by the standard deviation). Scikit-Learn provides functionality for this in the StandardScalar class.\n",
    "\n",
    "A couple of things to note.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Feature scaling usually isn't required for your target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Feature scaling is usually not required with tree-based models (e.g. Random Forest) since they can handle varying features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extra reading**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "When you first encounter them, ROC Curve and AUC (area under curve) metrics can be a little confusing. But not to worry, with a little practice, they'll start to make sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, what you should remember is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ROC curves and AUC metrics are evaluation metrics for binary classification models (a model which predicts one thing or another, such as heart disease or not).\n",
    "\n",
    "* The ROC curve compares the true positive rate (tpr) versus the false positive rate (fpr) at different classification thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The AUC metric tells you how well your model is at choosing between classes (for example, how well it is at deciding whether someone has heart disease or not). A perfect model will get an AUC score of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on these metrics, bookmark the following resources and refer to them when you need:\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Precision** - Indicates the proportion of positive identifications (model predicted class 1) which were actually correct. A model which produces no false positives has a precision of 1.0.\n",
    "* **Recall** - Indicates the proportion of actual positives which were correctly classified. A model which produces no false negatives has a recall of 1.0.\n",
    "* **F1 score** - A combination of precision and recall. A perfect model achieves an F1 score of 1.0.\n",
    "* **Support** - The number of samples each metric was calculated on.\n",
    "* **Accuracy** - The accuracy of the model in decimal form. Perfect accuracy is equal to 1.0, in other words, getting the prediction right 100% of the time.\n",
    "* **Macro avg** - Short for macro average, the average precision, recall and F1 score between classes. Macro avg doesn't take class imbalance into effect. So if you do have class imbalances (more examples of one class than another), you should pay attention to this.\n",
    "* **Weighted avg** - Short for weighted average, the weighted average precision, recall and F1 score between classes. Weighted means each metric is calculated with respect to how many samples there are in each class. This metric will favour the majority class (e.g. it will give a high value when one class out performs another due to having more samples).\n",
    "When should you use each?\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be tempting to base your classification models perfomance only on accuracy. And accuracy is a good metric to report, except when you have very imbalanced classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say there were 10,000 people. And 1 of them had a disease. You're asked to build a model to predict who has it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You build the model and find your model to be 99.99% accurate. Which sounds great! ...until you realise, all its doing is predicting no one has the disease, in other words all 10,000 predictions are false.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, you'd want to turn to metrics such as precision, recall and F1 score."
